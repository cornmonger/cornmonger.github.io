<h2>no tabs for helix</h2>
<p>it looks like the <a href="https://helix-editor.com">helix</a> developers are not keen on implementing something similar to <a href="https://neovim.io">vim's</a> tab feature.</p>
<p>someone on github even <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">submitted an implementation</a>. apparently, the team shelved it:</p>
<blockquote><span style="color: cyan;">nrabulinski</span><br/>I asked about it on matrix a while back and currently the team isn't interested, there's a bunch of code refactors they want to get around first in areas my PR touches, on top of in general there not being consensus whether this feature should be implemented like this</blockquote>
<p>there's a decent amount of people <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2295">requesting the feature</a>. it seems like a case of developers ignoring their users.</p>

<h2>steam deck otw</h2>
<p>ngl i am a little excited over the idea of hobby indie games for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">steam deck</a>. it's an expensive homebrew system, but considering that homebrew systems haven't really taken off ... maybe this is the direction needed.</p>
<p>i wouldn't be surprised if <a href="https://bevyengine.org">bevy</a> developers lined up for the steam deck if there were a solid path for publishing their projects on it.</p>
<p>xbox, playstation, and nintendo have yet to pick up the ball on indie rust games.</p>
<p>homebrew game development needs a console equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USF_Pro_Championships">road to indy</a>.</p>

<h2>my ai says</h2>
<p>&gt; you know what really grinds my gears?</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">when people don't use the proper tools for the job. like, come on, you're not going to use a
hammer to cut a piece of wood, are you? that's just silly.</p>
<p>seriously, though: <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">github copilot</a> might be just an expensive tab-complete for repetetive coding tasks, but it's definitely worth the expense.</p>
