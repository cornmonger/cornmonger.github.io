<h2>steam deck otw</h2>
<p>ngl i am a little excited over the idea of hobby indie games for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">steam deck</a>. it's an expensive homebrew system, but considering that homebrew systems haven't really taken off ... maybe this the direction needed.</p>
<p>i wouldn't be surprised if <a href="https://bevyengine.org">bevy</a> developers lined up for the steam deck if there were a solid path for publishing their projects on it.</p>
<p>xbox, playstation, and nintendo have yet to pick up the ball on indie rust games.</p>
<p>homebrew game development needs a console equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USF_Pro_Championships">road to indy</a>.</p>

<h2>my ai says</h2>
<p>&gt; you know what really grinds my gears?</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">when people don't use the proper tools for the job. like, come on, you're not going to use a
hammer to cut a piece of wood, are you? that's just silly.</p>
<p>seriously, though: <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">github copilot</a> might be just an expensive tab-complete for repetetive coding tasks, but it's definitely worth the expense.</p>
