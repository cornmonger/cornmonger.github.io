## &#127794; This Week: Git Internals

One of the projects that I'm building is designed around [Git](https://git-scm.com). Recently, I've began studying [Git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) and drafting out use cases with [Rust's git crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs).

One thing that I wasn't aware of is that there are manpage tutorials for Git: ```man gittutorial``` and ```man gittutorial-2``` are available on the commandline and they're very good introductions to general use and internals respectively.

## &#128212; mdBook is Online  

I've configured [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to point to an [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) installation, which now powers this little website. It was pretty easy to setup!
